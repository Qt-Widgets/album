# album
This is a E-albums program that was developed by C++/Qt .

I have an idle surface , I found it could be a E-album . so I wrote this application .

Support Qt4 And Qt5.

Usage:
1. put the photo into folder named "Picture".
2. start the Application.

ToDo:
1. Add a configuration page to modify parameters.
2. Add a FileWatch to the picture folder .
3. Add toggle animations.
